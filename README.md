[zoom](https://github.com/wavedrom/zoom) is a Waveform viewer implemented in JavaScript.
It is designed to fit your application and be extended with new functionality.

  * **Fast** enough to render large timing diagrams
  * **Zoomable** & **Scrollable** enough to see small details and the big picture
  * **Embeddable** so it can be integrated as a component into a bigger UI application
  * **Composable** with custom code and behaviors
  * **Reactive** to render required parts of a continuous stream from a simulator
